Salad Maker

Have you ever opened your fridge, seen some veggies that are almost past their best-before date, and wondered what can you make out of them?
Salad Maker is a web app which helps you to get some creative salad ideas from the veggies you already have in your fridge.
The app includes over 40 recipes which include over 50 different veggies!
Type in a veggie, click to add it to the list, and type in some more. Whenever you’re ready, click to find recipes! 
The recipes are ordered by the importance of your veggie in the recipe, and usually involve other ingredients too.
You can click on the title to get the link for the recipe!

To build this app we used:
- Flask
- Python
- Javascript
- Html
- CSS
- SQLite

Future Updates:
- Full Google search instead of a built-in DB
- Highlighting the veggies of your input on the recipes veggies list
- Error messages
- New design
- Save favorite recipes

This is Amit Shahar’s and Itan Brill's first programming project.
